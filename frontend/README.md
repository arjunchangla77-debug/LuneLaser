# Lune Laser Systems - Frontend

This is the React frontend for the Lune Laser Systems Invoice Management application.

## Backend Connection

## Fixed Issues

âœ… **JSON Parsing Errors Resolved**
- Updated API service to use absolute backend URLs instead of relative URLs
- Fixed CreateOffice, Dashboard, and AddLune components to call correct endpoints
- Configured environment variables for production deployment

## Deployment

This frontend is ready to be deployed on Vercel with the correct environment variables configured.

npm install
npm start
